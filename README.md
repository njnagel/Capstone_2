The Police Superintendent serves as an apointee of the mayor. It is the second-largest municipal police department in the United States. It has approximately 13,500 officers. There are 22 police districts, 50 wards, 77 Community Areas, and 285 beats. There is considerable overlap in the geographic designations, though no two classifications are 100% correlated.

In recent years, the United States Department of Justice has criticized the department for its poor training, lack of oversight and routine use of excessive force. The Wiki page provides a concise list of controversial events related to the CPD.

2017 Department of Justice report and agreement for enforcement

Following the McDonald shooting, Illinois State Attorney General Lisa Madigan requested that the US Department of Justice conduct a civil rights investigation of the Chicago Police Department. They released their report in January 2017, announcing an agreement with the city to work on improvements under court supervision. They strongly criticized the police for a culture of excessive violence, especially against minority suspects and the community, and said there was insufficient and poor training, and lack of true oversight.

# Project Purpose

The intent of this project is to look at Chicago crime data and assess whether there are abherent patterns that may indicate inconsistent policing over time, crime or location.


# Data

This dataset reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2010 to 2018, minus the most recent seven days. Data is extracted from the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. In order to protect the privacy of crime victims, addresses are shown at the block level only and specific locations are not identified. Should you have questions about this dataset, you may contact the Research & Development Division of the Chicago Police Department at 312.745.6071 or RandD@chicagopolice.org. Disclaimer: These crimes may be based upon preliminary information supplied to the Police Department by the reporting parties that have not been verified. The preliminary crime classifications may be changed at a later date based upon additional investigation and there is always the possibility of mechanical or human error. Therefore, the Chicago Police Department does not guarantee (either expressed or implied) the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or correct sequencing of the information and the information should not be used for comparison purposes over time. The Chicago Police Department will not be responsible for any error or omission, or for the use of, or the results obtained from the use of this information.

The columns in the original dataset include: CaseNumber, ID, Date, Block, IUCR, Primary Type (of Crime), Crime Description, Location Description, Beat, Ward, District, Community Area, Arrest (T/F), Domestic (T/F), X Coordinate, Y Coordinate, Latitude, Longitude, and Location.
